# The `instruct.md` file

`agents/<slug>/instruct.md` is the required-ish core file of an agent: a YAML frontmatter block followed by a Markdown operating-instructions body, both read by `loadAgent` (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts#loadAgent`). The file is split into `{ data, body }` by `parseFrontmatter`, which throws on malformed YAML (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/frontmatter.ts` `parseFrontmatter`). The whole file is optional — `loadAgent` guards the read with `fileExists(instructPath)` and falls back to an empty body and `title = slug` if absent (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:440-456`).

## Structure

An `instruct.md` is `---`-delimited frontmatter, then Markdown:

- The frontmatter `data` is parsed against a fail-loud allow-list — any key outside `AGENT_FRONTMATTER_ALLOWED_KEYS` (`title`, `knowledge`, `functions`, `components`, `actions`, `defaultAction`, `canDelegateTo`, `dependencies`, `capabilities`, `model`, `triggers`) throws (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:413-466`). The frontmatter fields themselves are documented in [frontmatter.md](./frontmatter.md).
- The `body` (everything after the closing `---`) is captured verbatim into `instructBody` (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:459`).

## The body is the operating instructions (system prompt)

The Markdown body is the agent's orchestration/routing instructions, injected into the system prompt as a `# Agent Instructions` section by `buildSystemBlock` (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/context/system-block.ts:232-234`). It is placed after the agent's charter, which is rendered as `# Agent` immediately before it (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/context/system-block.ts:229-231`).

The instruct body is top-level (and delegate) only — unlike `charter.md`, which is fork-safe identity/guardrails also injected into every fork; see [charter-file.md](./charter-file.md) for that split (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/context/system-block.ts:227-234`).

**There is no include or partial mechanism** — `loadAgent` reads exactly `instruct.md` and `charter.md` per agent directory (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts#loadAgent`), so a long body cannot be assembled from several prompt files. The supported way to keep it short is to move the detail into [`knowledge/`](../knowledge/README.md) and let the agent pull an aspect in with `loadKnowledge(domain, field, option)` at the moment it needs it: a two-part `knowledge:` ref lists the field and its aspect names in the prompt without injecting any of them (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/context/system-block.ts:259-314`). THING is the worked example — its body dropped from 1110 lines to ~500 that way; see [system-spaces §4.0](../../../system-spaces/README.md) for the arrangement, the one-turn cost of a load, and what must stay in the always-on body regardless.

## `actions[]` — id / label / description / tasklist

The frontmatter `actions:` list is parsed into `ActionDef` objects, each with `id`, `label`, `description`, and `tasklist` (all coerced to strings, defaulting to `''`) (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:493-505`). `ActionDef` is declared with exactly those four string fields (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts` `ActionDef`). Each action is rendered into the system prompt under `# Actions` as `` `<id>` — **<label>**: <description> (tasklist: <tasklist>)`` (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/context/system-block.ts:237-242`).

Every `action.tasklist` must resolve to a loaded tasklist in the same space, or `loadSpace` throws at load time (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:661-668`). Tasklists themselves are documented in [../tasklists/README.md](../tasklists/README.md).

## `defaultAction` — the host-driven fast path

`defaultAction` names an action `id` and is read verbatim from frontmatter (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/load.ts:471`). It is **not** a freeform fallback — it is the opposite. When a top-level session starts and the running agent declares a `defaultAction` whose action has a tasklist, the session takes a *structured*, host-driven fast path: it runs that action's tasklist via the reliable delegate path (`ctx.runDelegate`), which auto-captures the tasklist result, and then `return`s — the model-driven turn loop is never entered on that turn (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/session/session.ts:308-350`, returning at `:349`, ahead of the `runTurnLoop` call at `:352-353`). The action is resolved by matching `a.id === agent.defaultAction && a.tasklist` (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/session/session.ts:315-317`). The freeform, model-driven loop is what runs in the *other* case: when the agent declares no `defaultAction`, when the named action carries no tasklist, or when the routing is suppressed.

The fast path is consulted only in `start()`. `continue()` never reads `defaultAction`, so every turn after the first runs the model-driven turn loop regardless (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/session/session.ts#Session.continue`).

Suppression is the `noDefaultAction` session option (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/session/types.ts:39-41`), and the only thing that sets it is the CLI's `--no-default-action` flag (`sdk/org/libs/cli/src/cli/args.ts:144-147`), threaded into `SessionOpts` at each session-construction site in `bin.ts` (`sdk/org/libs/cli/src/cli/bin.ts:451,473,567,611`). No web or gateway caller passes it, so on the product surfaces an agent with a tasklist-bearing `defaultAction` always takes the fast path on its first turn.

## Worked example

Adapted from the real architect agent (`sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-architect/agents/architect/instruct.md:1-40`):

````markdown
---
title: Architect
knowledge:
  - space_format/frontmatter
functions:
  - writeAgentFile
  - validateSpace
components: []
defaultAction: synthesize_and_run
actions:
  - id: synthesize_and_run
    label: Synthesize & Run Agent
    description: Research the domain, design, scaffold, validate, register, and run a new specialist agent
    tasklist: synthesize_and_run
  - id: iterate_space
    label: Iterate on Existing Space
    description: Reconstruct, improve, re-scaffold, re-register, and re-run an existing synthesized agent
    tasklist: iterate_space
canDelegateTo:
  - "registered:*"
  - system-research/researcher
---

You have exactly TWO jobs, each a short fixed program. Pick the one that matches
the request and emit ONLY its statements. The heavy lifting happens INSIDE the
tasklist — the host runs every step for you.
````

Here `defaultAction: synthesize_and_run` points at the first action, whose `tasklist: synthesize_and_run` makes the session run that tasklist host-driven on start (`sdk/org/libs/core/src/session/session.ts:315-329`).
