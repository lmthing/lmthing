# App-authoring globals — `writeTableSchema` · `writeApi` · `writePage` · `writeHook` · `createProject` · `selectProject` · `apiCall`

The project-app authoring globals let a capability-holding agent **write the files of a project application** — table schemas, API handlers, React pages, hooks, emitter defs, project functions — and (via `apiCall`) **call the project's own API endpoints**. They are the sandbox side of the [project format](../format/project/README.md).

Two properties set them apart from the other runtime globals:

- **Every writer is a SYNCHRONOUS host call, not a yield.** They are bound straight onto the VM with `injectGlobal` and their DTS declares a plain object return, not a `Promise` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:20-27` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:189-233`. Only `apiCall` yields — it ends the turn because the host has to run a Node handler `sdk/org/libs/core/src/globals/api-call.ts:1-27`.
- **They are gated on the agent's `capabilities:` frontmatter alone** — *not* on `projectRoot` — because the appbuilder legitimately has no project until `createProject` makes one `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:162-179`. The one exception is `db`, which additionally requires a live project (see [data-db.md](./data-db.md)) `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:189-195`.

## The gate table

A capability that is not granted is **not injected AND not declared** — a stray call fails typecheck ("Cannot find name 'writePage'"), a clean retryable error, rather than throwing at runtime. Injection lives in `injectAppGlobals` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:198-222` (called once from the single bootstrap site `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/bootstrap.ts:143`); the matching DTS fragments are emitted by `buildAppCapabilityDts` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/bootstrap.ts:282-309` from `CAPABILITY_DTS_FRAGMENTS` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:266-275`.

| Capability | Catalog global | Live-project twin | File written | Format doc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `db:schema` | `writeTableSchema(name, schema)` | `writeProjectTable(name, schema)` | `database/<name>.json` | [database/](../format/project/database/README.md) |
| `api:write` | `writeApi(route, src)` | `writeProjectApi(route, src)` | `api/<path>/<METHOD>.ts` | [api/](../format/project/api/README.md) |
| `pages:write` | `writePage(route, src)` | `writeProjectPage(route, src)` | `pages/<route>.tsx` | [pages/](../format/project/pages/README.md) |
| `pages:write` | — | `writeProjectComponent(name, src)` | `components/<Name>.tsx` | [pages/](../format/project/pages/README.md) |
| `hooks:write` | `writeHook(slug, src)` | `writeProjectHook(slug, src)` | `hooks/<slug>.ts` | [hooks/](../format/project/hooks/README.md) |
| `hooks:write` | — | `writeProjectEvent(name, src)` | `events/<name>.ts` | [events/](../format/project/events/README.md) |
| `hooks:write` | — | `writeProjectFunction(name, src)` | `functions/<name>.ts` | [project format](../format/project/README.md) |
| `project:manage` | `createProject(id, opts?)`, `selectProject(id)` | — | scaffolds / selects a catalog app | — |
| `api:call` | `apiCall(name, input?)` — **yields** | same | — (calls, does not write) | [api/](../format/project/api/README.md) |

`db:schema` also earns the runtime `db.createTable` / `db.addColumn` members on the `db` object — a *migration*, distinct from the *schema-file* write `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:148-158` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:213-218`.

**Read-only fork roles (`explore`/`plan`) lose every authoring grant.** `intersectAppCaps(app, allowWrite=false)` keeps only `db:read`, `api:call`, `connections:use`, `tools:use`, `store:read`; `db:write`, `db:schema`, `pages:write`, `api:write`, `hooks:write`, `store:install`, `events:emit` are dropped before the profile is built `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/capability.ts#intersectAppCaps` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/capability.ts:94-97`.

---

## Two writer families: catalog vs live project

The same capability earns **two** writers, and they target different trees:

| | Catalog writers | Live-project writers |
|---|---|---|
| Target | `store/projects/<id>/…` — a store **template** | `<lmthingRoot>/<projectId>/…` — the **running** project |
| Impl | `createAppAuthoringGlobals` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:134-260` | `createProjectAuthoringGlobals` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:300-466` |
| Needs a selected project? | Yes — `createProject`/`selectProject` first (`requireCurrent()` throws otherwise) `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts#createAppAuthoringGlobals` | No — bound to one fixed project root at construction `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:300-312` |
| Applies the change? | No — "authoring never builds/migrates/installs; that happens at install+boot time, from the written source" `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:1-18` | Yes — republish / db reload / cache invalidation (below) |
| Parse-checks `src`? | No | Yes (`assertSourceParses`) `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:25-43` |
| Present when? | Always (the pod always constructs them) `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts#SessionManager.getProjectAppGlobals` | Only in a project-rooted session (that is where the host supplies the impls) `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:559-630` |

The catalog root is `<monorepoRoot>/store/projects` (or `LM_STORE_APPS_DIR`), always `mkdir -p`'d before use `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/catalog-root.ts#resolveCatalogRoot`.

Because injection requires the *impl* as well as the capability, a session where the host supplies no live impls has no `writeProject*` names bound — but the DTS fragments ride the same grant, so a stray call there still typechecks (see [Gotchas](#gotchas)) `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:200-218`.

---

## Signatures

Every writer returns `{ ok: boolean; error?: string }` — validation failures are **returned, never thrown into the sandbox**, so the model sees them and retries `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:8-11`. Each writer wraps its own body in `try/catch` and converts a throw into `{ ok:false, error }` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:193-249`.

### `createProject(id, opts?) → { ok, appId?, root?, error? }` — `project:manage`

Scaffolds `store/projects/<id>/` with `database/ pages/ api/ hooks/ components/ lib/`, a `package.json` (`@app/<id>`) and a `project.json` (`{ id, title, createdAt }`), then **selects** it as the authoring target `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:145-177`. Fails when `id` is not a kebab-slug, is the reserved `system`, or already exists.

### `selectProject(id) → { ok, appId?, root?, error? }` — `project:manage`

Binds an existing catalog app as the target; fails when the directory does not exist `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:179-191`. The selection is **one mutable value per SessionManager** (a lazy singleton), so it is shared across a delegation tree rather than reset per session `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:547-557`.

### `writeTableSchema(name, schema) → { ok, error? }` — `db:schema`

Writes `database/<name>.json` into the selected catalog app. `name` must be **snake_case** (`/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/`) — table names are interpolated unquoted into `CREATE TABLE`, so hyphens are rejected while `feed_items` is fine `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:61-66` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:86-90`. The schema then goes through core's fail-loud `validateTableSchema` — description required, ≥1 column, exactly one primary key, per-column type/`generated` checks `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:193-204` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/db/validate.ts#validateTableSchema`. Format → [../format/project/database/README.md](../format/project/database/README.md).

Real usage, from the `data-modeler` agent's instructions `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/data-modeler/instruct.md:12-27`:

````markdown
```typescript
const w = writeTableSchema('items', {
  title: 'Items',
  description: 'A single item the user tracks.',
  columns: {
    id: { type: 'string', description: 'unique id', primaryKey: true, generated: 'uuid' },
    title: { type: 'string', description: 'the item title', required: true },
    createdAt: { type: 'date', description: 'when it was added', generated: 'now' },
  },
});
display(w.ok ? 'wrote items schema' : ('schema error: ' + w.error));
```
````

### `writeApi(route, src) → { ok, error? }` — `api:write`

`route` carries the **HTTP method as its last segment**: `items-list/GET` → `api/items-list/GET.ts`; `items/[id]/PATCH` → `api/items/[id]/PATCH.ts`. The method must be one of `GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE`, and at least one path segment must precede it `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:77` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:219-237`. The handler contract (`export const name`, `Input`, `Output`, default async handler, `ctx.db`) → [../format/project/api/README.md](../format/project/api/README.md).

### `writePage(route, src) → { ok, error? }` — `pages:write`

Writes `pages/<route>.tsx`; the `.tsx` suffix is appended when absent `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:206-217`. `index` is the app root, `items/[id]` a dynamic route. Routing + the `@app/runtime` import surface → [../format/project/pages/README.md](../format/project/pages/README.md).

### `writeHook(slug, src) → { ok, error? }` — `hooks:write`

Writes `hooks/<slug>.ts`; `slug` must be a kebab-slug `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:239-249`. Hook def shapes (`cron` / `event` / `webhook`) → [../format/project/hooks/README.md](../format/project/hooks/README.md).

### Live-project writers — `writeProjectTable` · `writeProjectApi` · `writeProjectPage` · `writeProjectComponent` · `writeProjectHook` · `writeProjectEvent` · `writeProjectFunction`

Same signatures and the same slug/route/method/schema validation, but they write **into the project the session is running in** and then apply the change `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts#createProjectAuthoringGlobals`:

- Every successful write fires `republish()` — best-effort, fire-and-forget (the writers are synchronous, so they cannot await it; a republish failure never fails the write, because the file is already on disk). It re-derives the webhook manifest, crontab and emitter-scan cache and re-reads the project's hooks into the live db-write dispatch set, **without a pod restart** `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:314-330` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:641-653`.
  - That refresh **wires the dispatch runtime when the project has none yet**, it does not merely reload an existing one `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:724-732`. The runtime is otherwise created once, at the project db's first boot, and only if the project ALREADY has an event hook or a `db` emitter def `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:537-564`. A project's db comes into existence when its **first table** is authored — necessarily *before* its first hook exists — so wiring only at boot would leave a hook authored later dead until the pod restarted.
- `writeProjectTable` additionally fires `onSchemaWrite`, which drops the cached project db so the next access re-boots it — necessary because a project with no `database/*.json` boots **no db at all** and that `null` is cached `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:377-393` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:583-590`.
- `writeProjectPage` / `writeProjectApi` / `writeProjectComponent` fire `onAppWrite` — whose `kind` is now `'page' | 'api' | 'component'` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:329-332` — which drops the project's typed endpoint contracts and disposes its API runtime. **Page compilation is deliberately NOT done on write** — the caller must `POST /api/projects/:projectId/app/build` afterwards `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:591-609` (see [../cli-api/rest/projects.md](../cli-api/rest/projects.md)).
- `writeProjectComponent` writes a shared React component to `components/<Name>.tsx`; `<Name>` must be **PascalCase** (`COMPONENT_NAME_RE`) and `.tsx` is enforced `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:496-514` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:73-75`. It is a **live-project-only** writer — there is NO catalog counterpart (the typed writer replaced the removed space-rooted fs write for shared UI). Its DTS `PROJECT_COMPONENT_DTS` rides the `pages:write` grant `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts#PROJECT_COMPONENT_DTS` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts#CAPABILITY_DTS_FRAGMENTS`, injected only when the host supplies the live impl `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:219`.
- `writeProjectFunction` requires a **camelCase identifier**, not a slug — the file basename becomes the callable function name `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:70-71` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:352-365`.

**The live writers parse-check their source before it lands.** `assertSourceParses` runs an esbuild `transformSync` (loader `ts` or `tsx`) and rejects the write with `source failed to parse (write rejected — fix and retry): …`. It exists because models emitted literal `\n` escape sequences instead of newlines, producing one-line hook files that silently broke the automation pipeline `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:25-43`. The check is **syntax-only** — undefined identifiers are a typecheck concern, not a parse one.

**`writeProjectPage` guards a destructive overwrite.** It takes an optional third argument, `opts?: { replace?: boolean }` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts#writeProjectPage`. Without `replace`, a write onto an **existing** page whose source fetches ≥1 API route — every `useApi` / `useApiMutation` / `apiCall` with a literal route, per `fetchedRoutes` — is **rejected** when the incoming source fetches *none* of those routes `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts#wouldDropData`. A `@app/runtime` page reaches the database only through those hooks, so a replacement that drops them all renders nothing: the app still builds and every route still answers 200, while the user opens it to an empty page. (Live in scenario 07: a later "add an invoices section" turn re-authored `pages/index.tsx`, and a household's renewals/policies/accounts dashboard came back as `Home · [Invoices]` — with `/vault-dashboard` still serving the whole household to a page that no longer fetched it.) A first write, a page that fetched nothing anyway, and a rewrite that keeps ≥1 of its routes all pass; `{ replace: true }` is the explicit "the user asked me to remove those sections".

---

## Path safety (all writers)

Three layers, in order:

1. **Name/route regexes** — kebab-slug for project ids and hook/event slugs, snake_case for table names, JS identifier for function names, and per-segment `/^\[?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\]?$/` for page/api paths. No dots, no slashes; `.` and `..` are rejected explicitly `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:56-108`.
2. **`safeResolve(root, rel)`** — the resolved target must stay under the resolved root, else `path traversal rejected: "<rel>"` `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:110-119`.
3. One file per call, parent dirs created — **never a bulk delete, never a build step** `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:8-11` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:121-125`.

---

## `apiCall(name, input?) → Promise<any>` — `api:call`

The one **value-yielding** app global: it ends the turn, the host runs the endpoint (a worker-isolated Node handler), and the result is bound back into the VM `sdk/org/libs/core/src/globals/api-call.ts:1-27`. It is dual-addressed with the browser path — the page's `useApi` and the agent's `apiCall` enter the *same* main-process API runtime, the agent by endpoint **`name`** `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/api/runtime.ts:100-110`.

**The allow-list config is required.** A bare `api:call` is a hard space-load error — "there is no 'call anything'" `sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/capabilities.ts:317-323` — and the list must be a non-empty array of strings `sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/capabilities.ts:166-185`:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - api:call: { allow: [markRead, itemsList] }
```

**Typed overloads replace the generic signature.** When the host supplies project-generated contracts, `buildAppCapabilityDts` uses them *instead of* the generic `API_CALL_DTS` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/bootstrap.ts#AmbientDtsOpts` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:160`. They are built with `fallback: false`, so a wrong endpoint name **and** a wrong input type are both hard typecheck errors inside the sandbox `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/build/apicall-dts.ts:28-47` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/build/contracts.ts#generateProjectContracts`. One overload per endpoint:

```ts
declare function apiCall(name: 'markRead', input: { id: string }): Promise<{ ok: boolean }>;
```

**Error contract.** The pod resolver unwraps the API response: a status ≥ 400 becomes a thrown `Error` carrying `.status` (message taken from the handler's `{ error: { message } }` body), otherwise the body is returned — so the agent sees the same error shape the browser does `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:217-229`.

**Resolver seam.** The global is injected on the grant, but the host resolver may still be absent (a session outside a project, a project with no `api/`). The yield then rejects with a specific, retryable error rather than binding `undefined` `sdk/org/libs/core/src/eval/yield-router.ts:190-199`:

```
apiCall is not available here: this session has no project api runtime
```

In the pod the resolver is attached only when `getApiRuntime` returns a runtime, and that returns `null` for a project with no db `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts#SessionManager.getProjectAppGlobals` · `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:669-674`.

## Who holds these capabilities

Authoring lives in the **`system-appbuilder`** space; THING holds none of these grants and delegates in. The frontmatter is the whole gate:

| Agent | `capabilities:` | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `app-architect` | `project:manage`, `db:schema`, `db:read`, `pages:write`, `api:write`, `hooks:write` | orchestrates the whole build `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/app-architect/instruct.md:1-13` |
| `data-modeler` | `db:schema`, `db:read` | `writeTableSchema` `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/data-modeler/instruct.md:1-10` |
| `api-author` | `api:write`, `db:read` | `writeApi` `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/api-author/instruct.md:1-10` |
| `page-builder` | `pages:write`, `db:read` | `writePage` `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/page-builder/instruct.md:1-10` |
| `automator` | `hooks:write`, `db:schema`, `db:read`, `pages:write`, `api:write` | the **live-project** writers `sdk/org/libs/core/system-spaces/system-appbuilder/agents/automator/instruct.md:1-13` |

---

## Gotchas

- **The catalog writers do NOT parse-check `src`.** `assertSourceParses` is called only by the live-project writers; `writePage`/`writeApi`/`writeHook` write whatever string they are handed `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts:206-249` vs `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/authoring/globals.ts#createProjectAuthoringGlobals`.
- **DTS and injection are not in lockstep for the live twins.** `PROJECT_PAGE_DTS`/`PROJECT_API_DTS`/`PROJECT_AUTHORING_DTS`/`PROJECT_TABLE_DTS` are appended to their capability's fragment unconditionally `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:266-275` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/bootstrap.ts#AmbientDtsOpts.currentTask`, while injection additionally requires the host impl `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:204-218`. In a session where the host supplies no live impls (e.g. a non-project appbuilder run), `writeProjectPage(...)` passes typecheck and fails at runtime.
- **`api:call`'s `allow` list is not enforced at call time.** It is required at parse time and stored on the grant `sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/capabilities.ts:96-98` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/spaces/capabilities.ts:317-323`, but the typed DTS is generated from **every** endpoint in the project (`generateProjectContracts` → `buildApiCallDts(endpoints)`, no filter) `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/build/contracts.ts#generateProjectContracts`, and the pod resolver dispatches by name with no allow-list check `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts:217-229`. The filter `buildApiToolSignatures(endpoints, allow)` exists `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/app/build/apicall-dts.ts:61-80` but has no non-test caller (`rg buildApiToolSignatures libs/cli/src` matches only its own module and its test). Contrast `tools:use`, whose `allow` **is** narrowed into the DTS as a string-literal union `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/bootstrap.ts#AmbientDtsOpts` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts#composeConnectionsDts`.
- **`writeTableSchema` (schema *file*) ≠ `db.createTable` (live *migration*).** Both come from `db:schema`; the first writes a catalog `database/<name>.json`, the second runs a migration against the open project db `sdk/org/libs/core/src/exec/app-globals.ts:148-158` · `sdk/org/libs/core/src/typecheck/library-dts.ts:213-218`.
- **A "no db" project caches its `null`.** Only `writeProjectTable`'s `onSchemaWrite` drops that cache — a catalog `writeTableSchema` can never bring a live project's db into existence `sdk/org/libs/cli/src/server/session-manager.ts#SessionManager.liveProjectDb`.
